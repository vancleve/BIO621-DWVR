# Outline for today

0.  I was an R newbie too!
1.  Go over syllabus
2.  Install R and RStudio
3.  What is R?
4.  What are Markdown and R Markdown?

# Syllabus

-   The syllabus will be located here: <https://github.com/vancleve/BIO621-DWVR>.
-   This is also where R and R Markdown documents will be located. The only files that will be kept on the [Canvas site](https://uk.instructure.com/courses/2009268) are the PDF copies of the reference books and the completed labs and figures that you submit.
-   I'll update the syllabus and schedule of topics as necessary.

# Install R and RStudio

## Downloading

If you haven't already, download R and R studio

-   To download R, go here: <https://mirrors.nics.utk.edu/cran/>

-   To download RStudio, go here <https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/>\
    or here <https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/preview/>

    - Note: Either the regular or "preview version" is fine. 
    The "preview version" includes some new features, so feel free to get it if you'd like to play with them.

## Installing

If you need directions, especially for how update your packages if you already have R, go here: <https://stat545.com/install.html>

## Tidyverse

Many of the packages that packages that we will use have been helpfully collected together into a metapackage called `tidyverse`. Install this first thing by typing the following at the console:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

## Running RStudio

### What is RStudio?

RStudio is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for the R programming language.

While you can write R code in any text editor you like and then run that code with the R interpreter, there are many things that an IDE can do that help you be more efficient when programming.

1.  Syntax highlighting (e.g., see the markdown!)
2.  File/project organization (see "Files" pane)
3.  Examining variables that you've set (see the "Environment" pane)
4.  Easily execute code and examine its text output (see "Console") or graphical output (see "Viewer")
5.  View help files (see "Help")
6.  Installing/updating R packages (see "Tools" menu)
7.  Debugging (see "Debug" menu)
8.  Projects (see "File" and "Tools")

When using RStudio, I encourage you to:

1.  Play around with different arrangements for the windows/panes

2.  **LEARN KEYBOARD SHORTCUTS**. They can make you much, much more efficient.

    -   Shift+Alt+K (MAC/PC): Keyboard shortcut quick reference.
    -   Shift+Command/Control+K (MAC/PC): Knit current document (i.e., turn in HTML/DOCX/PDF)
    -   Command/Control+Enter (MAC/PC): Run selected lines
    -   Shift+Command/Control+Enter: Run current "chunk" (R Notebook only)
    -   etc

3.  Use a Project for all assignments in the course (save them in a single directory or its subdirectories).

For example, to generate 10 random numbers between 0 and 1 we can easily run the following code:

```{r}
runif(10)
```

To make sure you can do run the above, you want to run the following code that installs R Markdown:

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("rmarkdown")
```

## What is R?

### First, there was "S".

-   S was designed by John Chambers and others at Bell Labs in the 1970s specifically for data analysis and statistics.
-   R was developed in 1991 by **R**oss Ihaka and **R**obert Gentleman and re-implemented much of S after S became licensed software.

### Then there was "R"

-   R was open-sourced in 1995 and John Chambers and other statisticians are part of its core development team.
-   R is object-oriented (i.e., you can build containers of variables and the like), like Java.
-   R is interpreted (i.e., the interpreter turns interprets your text code immediately and runs it), like Python.
-   R has a tonne of packages for statistics and biology.
-   More on the basics of R next time.

# What are Markdown and R Markdown?

## Markdown: a plain text (i.e., just characters) way of "formatting" text

-   Markdown is a kind of "markup" language (e.g., HTML).
-   Designed for simplicity and readability
-   No need to "view" Markdown to read it easily
-   Often used in code documentation
-   Increasingly used in full document preparation (journal article, books, etc)

Ok, let's get Markdown!\
![](assets/dancing.gif)

First, this whole document is R Markdown, so you can quickly see examples of the following:

-   Headings are created with hash symbols "\#"

    -   "\#" is the "first" heading
    -   "\#\#" is the "second" heading, which is smaller (how much smaller? set by the "stylesheet")
    -   etc

-   *Italic text* in encapsulated by one \* or asterisk, **Bold text** by two asterisks.

-   Lists can start with -, \*, or +.

    -   Sublists are indented with four spaces.

-   New paragraphs are separated by blank lines.

    Line breaks, without a new paragraph, need two spaces\
    in order to be recognized. These can be used in lists too.

-   Links use angle brackets \<\>: <https://www.r-project.org/>

-   Links with different text use `[text](http://link.to.something)`

-   Images use `![](path.to.image)`

-   For more details, see [R Markdown cheat sheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/rmarkdown-2.0.pdf)

## R Markdown: a way to mix text (Markdown) and R code (R)

Ok, lets put some R in this thing.

Make a code "**chunk**"" with three back ticks followed by an r in braces. End the chunk with three back ticks:

```{r}
paste("Hello", "World!")
```

Place code inline with a single back ticks. The first back tick must be followed by an R, like this: `r paste("Hello", "World!")`.

You can control how the **chunks** work by adding options like `echo=FALSE` to hide the code when you create the HTML

```{r}
runif(10)
```

or you can add the option `eval=FALSE` so that the code isn't evaluated (see the `install.packages` lines in this `.Rmd`)

You can do plots too. Let's do one whose "name" is "cool_plot" (you can see the name in the `R Markdown` output, which is useful for debugging) and is just a bunch (1000) of normally distributed numbers (mean=0, std=1):

```{r cool_plot}
plot(rnorm(1000, 0, 1))
```

Now, lets do something a little more interesting. We can pull in data from all kinds of places including websites and actively updated databases. For example, here are COVID-19 cases numbers for the United States for Kentucky and Tennessee from the New York Times <https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data>:

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

us = read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/master/us-states.csv")
ky_tn = 
  us %>% 
  filter(state %in% c("Kentucky", "Tennessee")) %>% 
  pivot_wider(c(date, state), names_from = state, values_from = cases)
  
ky_tn_daily = 
  tibble(date = ky_tn$date[-1], Kentucky = diff(ky_tn$Kentucky), Tennessee = diff(ky_tn$Tennessee)) %>% 
  pivot_longer(-date, names_to = "state", values_to = "deaths")

ky_tn_daily %>% 
  filter(state %in% c("Kentucky", "Tennessee")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=date, y=deaths, color=state)) + 
  geom_line() + 
  labs(y="Cumulative COVID-19 deaths", color="State") +
  theme_classic()
```

## Reproducible Research

# Lab ![](assets/beaker.png)

#### Write a paragraph about what kind of data you are thinking of analyzing and visualizing

-   Create your own R Markdown document.

-   Give the document a title and author.

-   Use some Markdown elements to structure your document. Include the following:

    -   headings
    -   a link
    -   an image
    -   some bold or italic text

-   Make sure you can get proper HTML in RStudio.
    (I prefer the "Preview in Viewer Pane" under the gear icon for seeing HTML)

-   Remember to upload the file with a ".Rmd" suffix to Canvas.
